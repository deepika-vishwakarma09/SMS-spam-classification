SMS Spam Classification with Streamlit
Project Overview:
This project is a SMS Spam Classification application built using Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit. The app classifies incoming SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The app provides an easy-to-use interface for real-time classification using a trained machine learning model.

Technologies Used:
Python (version: 3.x)

Streamlit (for app development)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning model)

Pandas (for data manipulation)

Numpy (for numerical operations)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

Pickle (for saving the trained model)

Features:
Real-time Spam Classification: Input an SMS and the model will classify it as spam or ham.

Model Performance: View metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix to assess the performance of the model.

User-friendly Interface: Built using Streamlit, making the app easy to deploy and interact with.

Installation:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sms-spam-classification.git
cd sms-spam-classification
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage:
To run the app locally, use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
This will open a browser window where you can input SMS text and get predictions (Spam or Ham).

Model Training:
The machine learning model is trained on a dataset of SMS messages with labels indicating whether the message is spam or not.

The model is trained using algorithms like Logistic Regression , Naive Bayes ,SVM, ensemble learning,and xgboost(these modes check under notebook then apply nive Bayes in our project).

The trained model is saved using Pickle and loaded in the Streamlit app for making predictions.

Project Structure:
app.py: The Streamlit app that serves as the front-end interface.

model.pkl: The saved machine learning model used for predictions.
